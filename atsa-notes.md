# ATSA Notes

## 2/2/21
 * Big Data : any collection of data that is too big to be held in the memory of your computer
 * resolution / number of samples are not "big data"
 * the four Vs
   * volume (but also how fast can we process it)
   * velocity
   * variety
   * veracity (truth / being honest)
* modeling
  * focus on the hows and whys not the results to explain what we depict
     * need to understand the context of your findings
  * storing data models in lieu of big data
     * focus on probability distribution rather than mean and variance in a dataset
  * are there always models and nois to be identified within a dataset?
     * if true, then a random variable occuring in time then the data is time series
* forecasting
  * if there are patterns in data, can we predict the future? (yes it is possible)
